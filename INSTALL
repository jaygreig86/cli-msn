=========================================================================
Typographical conventions
=========================================================================

Command lines written as

	# command

should be executed as the superuser.

Command lines written as

	% command

should be executed as an unpriveleged user.

=========================================================================
Build Requirements
=========================================================================

	o ANSI/ISO C89/C90 C compiler, e.g GNU gcc
	o ANSI C, NCurses Library, Lib Crypto, Lib SSL, Zlib
	o Disk space: 44k to unpack, 88k to bild, 20k to install

=========================================================================
Installing
=========================================================================

1. Compile CLI-MSN
   Run 'make' from the top-level directory.  With some systems you may 
   need to use 'gmake' or even 'gnumake' instead of the default system
   make.

	% make

  The above procedure will suit an unpriveleged user to simply run
  the client from their home directory (See Running below).

2. Test CLI-MSN
   To simply test that the software compiled correctly, the following
   command is used.

	% ./msn

   The program should then run sucessfuly showing the coloured interface.

3. Install CLI-MSN
   If you are a system administrator and wish to allow yourself and 
   unpriveleged users to use CLI-MSN, then the following instructions
   can be used to achieve this.

   Run 'make install' from the top-level directory.  This will install the binary
   'msn' into /usr/local/bin/.

	# make install

=========================================================================
Running
=========================================================================

If you followed steps 1 through 3 the client is assumed to be installed
in /usr/local/bin.  The client can now be run from the command line
simply by using the command msn.

	# msn

To login and run the client the user@host to login with must be specified.

	# msn example@hotmail.com

See the README file for more information.
